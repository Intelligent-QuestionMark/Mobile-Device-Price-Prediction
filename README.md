# General Workflow
1. Clone repo
2. Create a colab notebook for your task(s)
3. Download notebook
4. Place notebook in your clone of the repo, wherever you want it (feel free to create subfolders as necessary)
5. Good to do an initial commit at this stage
6. Work on tasks in colab, download new notebook to your clone (or work on the notebook directly locally), and then commit the changes

**Alternatively, if we make this repo public (or maybe if we're made owners?) you can link your colab notebook directly to this repo, and specify the branch and directory to put it in.**
